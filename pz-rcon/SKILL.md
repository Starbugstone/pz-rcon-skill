# Project Zomboid RCON - Atmosphere & Events

Make your Project Zomboid server feel alive with narrative broadcasts, rewards, and dynamic events.

## Prerequisites

Install `rcon-cli` (gorcon):
```bash
# Download from https://github.com/gorcon/rcon-cli/releases
```

## Connection

```bash
rcon -a <host>:<port> -p <password> <command>
```

Default RCON port = game port + 1 (e.g., 16261 → 16262).

## Commands

### Broadcasting Messages

Send atmospheric messages to all players:
```
servermsg "The emergency broadcast system crackles... Stay indoors tonight."
```

**Narrative ideas:**
- Weather warnings before triggering storms
- "Distant gunfire echoes from the west..."
- Radio broadcasts about supply drops
- Creepy night-time announcements

### Giving Items

```
additem "username" <Module.Item> <count>
```

Examples:
```
additem "Player1" Base.Axe 1
additem "Player1" Base.Shotgun 1
additem "Player1" Base.WaterBottleFull 5
additem "Player1" Base.FirstAidKit 2
```

Common items (note: item IDs can differ between builds/mods; if you get “Item X doesn’t exist”, try another item or consult the server’s item list): `Base.Axe`, `Base.Pistol`, `Base.Shotgun`, `Base.Crowbar`, `Base.Hammer`, `Base.WaterBottleFull`, `Base.Bread`, `Base.FirstAidKit`, `Base.Bandage`, `Base.9mmClip`

Full list: https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Items

### Giving XP

```
addxp "username" <Perk>=<amount>
```

Examples:
```
addxp "Player1" Woodwork=100
addxp "Player1" Aiming=50
addxp "Player1" Fitness=200
addxp "Player1" PlantScavenging=100
```

**B42 note:** Perk names changed/expanded (e.g. `Foraging` → `PlantScavenging`, `Carpentry` → `Woodwork`). If you’re unsure, run `addxp` with a bogus value and the server will often print the available perk list.

Common perks (B42-ish): Aiming, Reloading, Axe, Blunt, LongBlade, SmallBlade, Spear, Maintenance, Woodwork, Cooking, Doctor, Electricity, Mechanics, Tailoring, MetalWelding, Fitness, Strength, Sprinting, Sneak, Lightfoot, Nimble, PlantScavenging, Tracking, Trapping, Fishing, Farming

### Spawning Vehicles

```
addvehicle "<script>" "<username>"
```

Examples:
```
addvehicle "Base.VanAmbulance" "Player1"
addvehicle "Base.PickUpVan" "Player1"
```

Vehicles: `Base.CarNormal`, `Base.CarStationWagon`, `Base.PickUpVan`, `Base.VanAmbulance`, `Base.Van`, `Base.ModernCar`

### World Events

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `createhorde <count> "user"` | Spawn zombies near player |
| `chopper` | Helicopter flyover (random player) |
| `gunshot` | Gunshot sound (attracts zombies) |
| `alarm` | Building alarm (admin in room) |
| `lightning "user"` | Lightning strike near player |
| `thunder "user"` | Thunder sound |

**Event narration pattern:**
1. Broadcast warning message
2. Wait a moment
3. Trigger event

Example flow:
```
servermsg "A helicopter is spotted on the horizon..."
# wait
chopper
```

### Weather Control

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `startrain` | Start rain |
| `startrain <1-100>` | Rain with intensity |
| `stoprain` | Stop rain |
| `startstorm <hours>` | Start storm (game hours) |
| `stopweather` | Clear all weather |

**Weather narration:**
```
servermsg "Dark clouds gather overhead. Seek shelter."
startrain
# later...
startstorm 2
servermsg "The storm is upon us. This is going to be a rough night."
```
