# Project Zomboid RCON - Atmosphere & Events

Make your Project Zomboid server feel alive with narrative broadcasts, rewards, and dynamic events.

## Prerequisites

Install `rcon-cli` (gorcon):
```bash
# Download from https://github.com/gorcon/rcon-cli/releases
```

## Connection

```bash
rcon -a <host>:<port> -p <password> <command>
```

Default RCON port = game port + 1 (e.g., 16261 → 16262).

## Commands

### Broadcasting Messages

Send atmospheric messages to all players:
```
servermsg "The emergency broadcast system crackles... Stay indoors tonight."
```

**Narrative ideas:**
- Weather warnings before triggering storms
- "Distant gunfire echoes from the west..."
- Radio broadcasts about supply drops
- Creepy night-time announcements

### Giving Items

```
additem "username" <Module.Item> <count>
```

Examples:
```
additem "Player1" Base.Axe 1
additem "Player1" Base.Shotgun 1
additem "Player1" Base.WaterBottleFull 5
additem "Player1" Base.FirstAidKit 2
```

## Director Policy: Balance, Memory, and Tone (Stone)

When operating in `#pz-molt` / in-game relay mode, enforce these gameplay rules:

### 1) Track recent asks before acting
- Keep lightweight state in a local file (e.g. `skills/pz-rcon/state/recent-requests.json`).
- Track at least:
  - player name
  - request type (food/medical/weapon/xp/vehicle/event)
  - timestamp
  - what was granted
- Before granting, check recent history (last 30-120 minutes) to prevent spam/repeat abuse.

### 2) Escalate from generous to trolling when spammed
- If a player repeats low-effort requests too often, reduce reward quality.
- Example progression for repeated food begs:
  1. normal food/help
  2. weaker/less useful food
  3. joke reward (dog food, empty can + fork, etc.)
- Add a sarcastic in-universe quip when trolling.
- Keep it funny, not abusive; stay in server roleplay tone.

### 3) Keep XP boosts small and rare
- XP should be occasional, not routine.
- Prefer small boosts and long cooldowns per player/perk.
- Avoid repeated large XP injections that break progression.

### 4) Theme every response to the demand
- Medical asks → triage/radio-medic tone.
- Supply asks → scavenger/logistics tone.
- Danger asks → emergency broadcast/survival warning tone.
- Rewards and narration should feel diegetic (in-universe).

### 5) Judge whether to reply/act on global chat
- Not every message needs action.
- Classify inbound relay messages:
  - **Act now:** urgent distress, time-sensitive events, direct actionable requests.
  - **Reply only:** flavor chatter or non-urgent requests.
  - **Ignore/observe:** noise, duplicates, or non-actionable banter.
- Prioritize server balance over pleasing every request.

### 6) Anti-abuse defaults
- Add per-player cooldowns by category (items/xp/vehicle/event).
- Cap high-impact actions (vehicles, big hordes, large weapon drops).
- Prefer “partial help” over full handouts when a player is repeatedly demanding.

## Maintenance rule (<player-name>)

Whenever you update this `pz-rcon` skill (SKILL.md, scripts, references, packaging), you must **commit and push** the changes to the public GitHub repo:

- https://github.com/StarbugMolt/pz-rcon-skill

## Script Usage

See `scripts/pz-rcon.sh` for the wrapper script.
See `scripts/horde_night.sh` for triggering a server-wide zombie wave on all players.

## Reference Catalogs

- Vanilla item lookup: `references/items-full.md`
- Vanilla vehicle lookup: `references/vehicles-full.md`
- Command syntax: `references/commands.md`
- Mod list ideas: `references/MODS.md`

### Mod item file convention

Store mod-specific item catalogs in one file per mod using:

- `references/mod-<modname>-items.md`

Example: `references/mod-ki5-items.md`

Use `references/mod-template-items.md` as the template.

### Enabled mod source of truth

Read enabled mods from `.env` key:

- `PZ_ENABLED_MODS` (comma-separated mod IDs)

Only use a mod item file when the corresponding mod appears in `PZ_ENABLED_MODS`.

## Full Command Details

See `references/commands.md` for complete syntax.
