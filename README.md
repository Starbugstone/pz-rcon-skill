# pz-rcon (OpenClaw Skill) — Project Zomboid Atmosphere Director

This repository contains an OpenClaw skill called **`pz-rcon`**.

It’s designed to make a **Project Zomboid** dedicated server feel more alive by using **RCON** to:
- broadcast in-universe / narrative messages to online players
- reward players with **items / XP / vehicles**
- trigger **events** (hordes, helicopter, gunshot, alarms)
- control **weather** (rain, storms, clear)

It intentionally does **NOT** include moderation or server lifecycle control (no bans/whitelist/shutdown/etc.).

## Contents

- `pz-rcon/` — the skill folder
  - `SKILL.md` — skill instructions (what the agent loads)
  - `scripts/pz-rcon.sh` — helper wrapper around `rcon-cli`
  - `references/` — extra docs and command reference
- `pz-rcon.skill` — packaged skill file (zip with `.skill` extension)

> **Note:** `.skill` is just a **ZIP archive** with a different extension. GitHub will show it as a binary blob. To inspect it, download it and run:

> ```bash
> unzip pz-rcon.skill -d extracted-skill
> # or: mv pz-rcon.skill pz-rcon.zip && unzip pz-rcon.zip -d extracted-skill

## Prerequisites

### 1) Enable RCON on your PZ server

Edit your server config (often `servertest.ini`) to include:

```ini
RCONPort=16262
<PZ_RCON_PASSWORD>=CHANGE_ME
```

Notes:
- RCON port is usually **game port + 1**.
- Treat the password like root access.

### 2) Install `rcon-cli` (gorcon)

This skill’s wrapper uses **gorcon/rcon-cli**:

- Releases: https://github.com/gorcon/rcon-cli/releases

Confirm it works:

```bash
rcon --help
```

## Quick start (using the wrapper script)

Set environment variables:

```bash
export PZ_RCON_HOST="your.server.ip"
export PZ_RCON_PORT="16262"
export <PZ_RCON_PASSWORD>="your_password"
```

Then run:

```bash
cd pz-rcon
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh players
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "Emergency broadcast: stay indoors tonight."
```

## What you can do

### See who’s online

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh players
```

### Broadcast narrative messages

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "*static* ...This is Knox Emergency Radio..."
```

Good pattern:
1) message
2) wait a beat
3) trigger event/weather
4) follow-up message

### Reward players with items

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh give "PlayerName" Base.Axe 1
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh give "PlayerName" Base.FirstAidKit 1
```

Item codes are `Module.ItemName`:

### Grant XP perks

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh xp "PlayerName" Carpentry=100
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh xp "PlayerName" Aiming=50
```

### Spawn a vehicle

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh vehicle Base.VanAmbulance "PlayerName"
```

### Trigger events

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh horde 50 "PlayerName"
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh chopper
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh gunshot
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh alarm
```

### Control weather

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh rain 50
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh storm 2
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh clear
```

## “Director” mini playbooks

### 1) Storm night (mood setter)

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "National Weather Service: severe storm incoming."
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh rain 35
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "If you’re outside, that’s between you and Darwin."
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh storm 3
```

### 2) Supply drop… with teeth

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "Military broadcast: supply cache spotted near the gas station."
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh give "PlayerName" Base.Shotgun 1
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh give "PlayerName" Base.ShotgunShells 12
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "...unfortunately, you’re not the only one who heard that."
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh horde 40 "PlayerName"
```

### 3) Helicopter escalation

```bash
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "A helicopter is circling. Do NOT wave at it."
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh chopper
./scripts/pz-rcon.sh msg "If you can hear it, they can hear you."
```

## Maintenance rule (project workflow)

If you modify the `pz-rcon` skill in this repo, you must **commit and push** the updates so others (and <player-name>) can pull the latest version.

## Installing the skill into OpenClaw

If you’re using OpenClaw skills:
- Import the packaged `pz-rcon.skill`, or
- Copy the `pz-rcon/` folder into your skills directory.

(Exact installation depends on how your OpenClaw instance is configured.)

## Safety notes

- Avoid running event commands too frequently; it can ruin pacing.
- Prefer “soft narration” over spam: 1–3 lines, then let players play.
- Keep rewards rare enough to feel meaningful.

## License

MIT — see `LICENSE`.

## Reference Catalogs (Vanilla + Mods)

To keep lookup clean and deterministic, the skill uses structured catalogs:

- Vanilla items: `pz-rcon/references/catalogs/vanilla/items-full.md`
- Vanilla vehicles: `pz-rcon/references/catalogs/vanilla/vehicles-full.md`
- Mod templates/files: `pz-rcon/references/catalogs/mods/`
  - Naming convention: `mod-<modname>-items.md`

### Active mod scope

Enabled mods are declared in:

- `pz-rcon/.env` → `PZ_ENABLED_MODS` (comma-separated mod IDs)

Skill lookup policy:
1. Always allow all entries from vanilla catalogs.
2. Only allow mod catalog entries for mods present in `PZ_ENABLED_MODS`.

### Env templates

- Local secrets/runtime config: `pz-rcon/.env` (not committed)
- Shareable template: `pz-rcon/.env.example`

## Dual Runtime Modes (Game Master Flow)

The skill now separates live-ops behavior into two tracks:

1. **Ambient Director Loop**
   - Script: `pz-rcon/scripts/ambient_tick.sh`
   - Intended cadence: every 5 minutes
   - Behavior: if players are online, emit themed atmosphere messages; trigger events rarely with cooldowns.

2. **Help/Request Handler**
   - Policy helper: `pz-rcon/scripts/request_policy.py`
   - Behavior: answer direct player asks, apply anti-spam ladder (`normal` → `reduced` → `punish`) and keep balance.

State files:
- `pz-rcon/state/narrative-state.json`
- `pz-rcon/state/recent-requests.json`
